/*:step-start: {
   "id": "my-step-id", 
   "title": "Connect to Your MongoDB Realm App"
}
To get the app working with your backend, you first need to add your Realm App 
ID to the config.js file. The config.js module exports a single property, 
realmAppId, which is currently set to “TODO”:

:include-code-block: {
   "id": "realmAppId",
   "state": "start"
}

Change this value to your Realm App ID. 

.. note::

   To learn how to find your MongoDB Realm ``appId``, read the :doc:`Find
   Your App Id </get-started/find-your-app-id>` doc.

Once you have made that change, you now need to complete the code needed to 
open a {+realm+}. In ``index.js``, find the ``openRealm`` function. It will look 
like this:

:include-code-block: {"emphasize_lines": "1,5", "line_numbers": "false","id": "foo","state": "start"}
Replace the ``TODO`` line with a line of code that opens a {+realm+} and assigns 
it to the ``realm`` property:

:include-code-block: {
   "id": "foo",
   "state": "final",
   "note": "this code block is in another file!",
   "emphasize_lines": "1-3",
   "line_numbers": "true"
}

At this point, your app is pointing to your backend and opens a connection 
to it when you start the app. However, users cannot yet log in, so let's update 
that code next.

I'm step 2. That's cool, right?
I'm using the default property of the step-start
rather than passing in an object. That makes me
cooler than the previous step.
