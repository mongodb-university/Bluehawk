# Bluehawk

A file-parsing tool & markup schema

## What it does

Given a file (or directory of files) that use the markup tags, Bluehawk parses
the file and outputs one or more files. There are 2 main processes:

- **Step files:** Bluehawk will generate a markdown file with numbered steps and
  included code blocks. You can import this as some -- or all -- of the steps
  in a tutorial.

- **Code files:** For each code file that has one or more code-blocks defined,
  Bluehawk generates a minimum of 4 files:

  - Each code block, pulled out of the main code file, and parsed into it's
    "start" and "final" states. These files are saved
    as ** _{original_file_name}_.codeblock._{code_block_id}_._{extension}_ **

  - The entire code file, with all of the code-blocks parsed into their
    "start" and "final" states. These files are saved in the **start** and
    **final** folders with the original file name.

### Start and Final?

A concept originally lifted from another internal project called "peekaboo",
the idea is that you can develop a final code solution (say, a complete tutorial
application), and then strip out parts that you want the learner to figure out
and code themselves. So, one code base (compiles, passes tests, etc.) can be used
to generate both a "starter" version for a learner and a "final" version so they
can check their work....or just download it and cheat.

## How to run Bluehawk

First, install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To build, run:

```
npm run-script build
```

If compilation is successful, you can run bluehawk like so:

```sh
node build/index.js -s <folder to source file or directory>
```

Which you can alias (until release):

```sh
alias bluehawk="node /path/to/bluehawk/build/index.js"
```

The `-s or --source` parameter is required. Other optional parameters include:

- `-d or --destination` defines the output location. Under the specified location,
  Bluehawk creates the following structure:

  ```
  {output}
  |-> steps
  |-> code
      |-> start
      |-> final
  ```

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest to test.

To run all tests, use:

```sh
npm test
```

To run the tests and get verbose output for all unit tests, use:

```sh
npm run verbose
```

Additionally, you can get a Jest coverage report with:

```sh
npm run coverage
```

You can also run tests with breakpoints in VS Code with F5. See .vscode/launch.json.

## The Markup

There are 2 categories of tags, corresponding to the two output types:

### Step Files

Insert the following "tags" to define the beginning and end of a tutorial step.
For each "step block", Bluehawk will create a new numbered step, with an `id` and
title that correspond to the values you provide.

**:step-start:** Creates a new step in the step file and copies the text found in the
following comment lines until a :step-end: is encountered. Both the `title` and `id`
properties are required:

```
:step-start: {
    id: ...,
    title: ...
}
```

**:step-end:** Ends the current step. It has no properties.

**:include-code-block:** Indicates that a code-block needs to be created here
using code found elsewhere in this file until a :step-end: is encountered.

```
:include-code-block: {
  id: ...,
  code-state: "start" | "final"
  emphasize-lines: 1 | 1-4 | 1,5,7
  line-numbers: true | false
}
```

### Code Files

When generating code blocks from a code file, use the following markup. Note: you
use either single-line commenting or block commenting for all tags to keep the
compiler happy.

| Syntax                      | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **:code-block-start:** _id_ | Creates a new step in the step file and defines the start of a chunk of code to be placed within a code-block directive.    |
|                             |                                                                                                                             |
| **:hide-start:**            | When generating the starting code, hide the following lines until you reach a **:hide-end:** or **:replace-with:** command. |
|                             |                                                                                                                             |
| **:replace-with:**          | Stop removing lines of code, and insert the following lines until you reach a **:hide-end:** command.                       |
|                             |                                                                                                                             |
| **:hide-end:**              | Stop removing lines of code                                                                                                 |
| **:code-block-end:**        | End of the code block.                                                                                                      |

### Start, End, Hide, Replace...I'm confused.

All code and comments between **:hide-start:** and **:hide-end:** will not be
included in the "start" version of the output, _except_ whatever is between the
**:hide-start:** and **:replace-with:** tags. All code in the hide block
_will_ be included in the "final" output _except_ the lines defined in the
"replace" section. For a simple example, consider the following input:

```
// :code-block-start:openRealm1
// :hide-start:

notInStartCode: true,
inFinalCode: true,

// :replace-with:
// // A You should only see this in the start code
// start1: true,
// final1: false,
// // comment in start code: ... ,
// :hide-end:
// :code-block-end:
```

Bluehawk will generate the following output:

**Start version**

```
// A You should only see this in the start code
start1: true,
final1: false,
// comment in start code: ... ,
```

**Final version**

```
notInStartCode: true,
inFinalCode: true,
```
